Hello there!
PyShell is a command-line interface that executes commands and manages processes.
In this challenge, I had to build my own [POSIX compliant](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html) shell
that's capable of interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands like cd, pwd, echo, and more.

Actual builtin commands: echo, type, pwd, cd, clear.
W.I.P Redirect Output

Can run external commands like cat and ls.
